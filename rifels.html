        <p class="about"> The Indian Army uses a wide range of rifles to meet the diverse needs of its infantry and special forces. The
            INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) rifle was the standard issue for many years but is now being gradually
            phased out. It is being replaced by the more advanced SIG716 assault rifles, acquired from the U.S., known
            for their superior accuracy and reliability. The AK-203, a modernized version of the AK-series rifles, is
            also being jointly produced in India with Russia and is set to become a major frontline weapon. For
            close-quarter combat and special operations, elite units use Tavor X95 and AK-47 variants. Sniper rifles
            like the Dragunov SVD and newer bolt-action rifles are used for long-range engagements. The Army is also
            focusing on modernizing its small arms with better sights, optics, and modular systems. This evolving
            arsenal enhances the operational effectiveness of Indian troops in diverse combat environments.

                        <p class="card-text content">The AK-203 assault rifle is a modern, high-performance firearm
                            developed jointly by India and Russia. It is a derivative of the legendary AK-47, combining
                            its reliability with modern features like improved ergonomics and accuracy. The rifle is
                            chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge, offering powerful stopping power suitable for various
                            combat situations. It is lightweight, durable, and effective in extreme conditions, making
                            it ideal for Indian Army soldiers. The AK-203 is being produced under the Make in India
                            initiative at a facility in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh. Once fully deployed, it will replace the
                            older INSAS rifles, boosting the Army's firepower and combat readiness.

                        <p class="card-text content">The Light Machine Gun (LMG) is a vital support weapon used by the
                            Indian Army to provide sustained suppressive fire during combat. Traditionally, the Army
                            relied on the INSAS LMG, which offered moderate firepower but faced issues with reliability
                            and performance. To modernize its firepower, the Army has begun inducting Negev NG7 LMGs
                            from Israel, known for their higher rate of fire, better accuracy, and rugged design. LMGs
                            are typically operated by a two-man team and are essential for laying down cover fire during
                            advances or defenses. They are used in a variety of terrains, including counter-insurgency
                            operations. The new generation of LMGs significantly boosts infantry unit effectiveness and
                            fire superiority.

                        <h5 class="card-title" style="color: blue;">Dragunov Sniper Rifle</h5>
                        <p class="card-text content">The Dragunov Sniper Rifle (SVD) is a semi-automatic designated
                            marksman rifle of Russian origin, widely used by the Indian Army. Chambered for the
                            7.62×54mmR cartridge, it is designed for accurate long-range shooting, typically up to 800
                            meters. It features a PSO-1 optical sight, wooden or polymer furniture, and a lightweight
                            design for mobility in the field. The Dragunov is not a true sniper rifle but bridges the
                            gap between standard infantry rifles and specialized sniper weapons. It has served reliably
                            in various terrains, from mountains to deserts. The Indian Army is gradually modernizing its
                            sniper arsenal, but the Dragunov remains in use due to its proven effectiveness.
