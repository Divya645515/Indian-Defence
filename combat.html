    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="content-1">
        <p>India's indigenous combat aircraft program has made significant strides with the development of the HAL Tejas series, particularly the Tejas Mk2, also known as the Medium Weight Fighter (MWF). Designed to replace aging fleets of SEPECAT Jaguar, Mirage 2000, and MiG-29 aircraft, the Tejas Mk2 represents a substantial upgrade over its predecessor, the Tejas Mk1.</p>
    
        <p>The Tejas Mk2 features a canard delta wing configuration, providing enhanced maneuverability and stability. It is powered by the General Electric F414 engine, offering greater thrust and performance compared to the F404 engine used in the Mk1 variant. The aircraft incorporates advanced avionics, including an indigenous Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system, and a Unified Electronic Warfare Suite (UEWS), enhancing its combat capabilities. The cockpit is equipped with a wide-area display, holographic head-up display, and hands-on throttle-and-stick controls, improving pilot situational awareness and reducing workload</p>

            <p class="para1">The HAL Tejas is India's indigenous single-engine, 4.5-generation multirole combat aircraft, developed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Navy. Featuring a tailless, compound delta wing design, the Tejas is renowned for its agility and maneuverability. It is constructed using advanced composite materials, which constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, reducing weight and enhancing structural strength.</p>
            <p class="para2">The Tejas program has evolved through several variants: the initial Mark 1, the enhanced Mark 1A, and the upcoming Mark 2. The Mark 1A incorporates over 40 improvements, including an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, electronic warfare capabilities, and in-flight refueling. The Mark 2, currently under development, will feature a more powerful engine, increased payload capacity, and advanced avionics.</p>
