    <div class="content-1">
        <p>India's indigenous combat aircraft program has made significant strides with the development of the HAL Tejas series, particularly the Tejas Mk2, also known as the Medium Weight Fighter (MWF). Designed to replace aging fleets of SEPECAT Jaguar, Mirage 2000, and MiG-29 aircraft, the Tejas Mk2 represents a substantial upgrade over its predecessor, the Tejas Mk1.</p>
    
        <p>The Tejas Mk2 features a canard delta wing configuration, providing enhanced maneuverability and stability. It is powered by the General Electric F414 engine, offering greater thrust and performance compared to the F404 engine used in the Mk1 variant. The aircraft incorporates advanced avionics, including an indigenous Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system, and a Unified Electronic Warfare Suite (UEWS), enhancing its combat capabilities. The cockpit is equipped with a wide-area display, holographic head-up display, and hands-on throttle-and-stick controls, improving pilot situational awareness and reducing workload</p>

            <p class="para1">The HAL Tejas is India's indigenous single-engine, 4.5-generation multirole combat aircraft, developed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Navy. Featuring a tailless, compound delta wing design, the Tejas is renowned for its agility and maneuverability. It is constructed using advanced composite materials, which constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, reducing weight and enhancing structural strength. The Tejas program has evolved through several variants: the initial Mark 1, the enhanced Mark 1A, and the upcoming Mark 2. The Mark 1A incorporates over 40 improvements, including an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, electronic warfare capabilities, and in-flight refueling. The Mark 2, currently under development, will feature a more powerful engine, increased payload capacity, and advanced avionics.</p>

            The Dassault Rafale is a French twin-engine, canard delta-wing multirole fighter aircraft developed by Dassault Aviation. Designed as an "omnirole" aircraft, the Rafale is capable of performing a wide range of missions, including air superiority, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike, and nuclear deterrence. It is equipped with advanced avionics, including the RBE2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the SPECTRA electronic warfare system, and the Front Sector Optronics (FSO) system, providing superior situational awareness and survivability. India has incorporated the Rafale into its defense forces to enhance its aerial capabilities. The Indian Air Force (IAF) operates 36 Rafale jets, which have been deployed in various missions, including Operation Sindoor, where they were used to strike terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Rafale's advanced weaponry, such as the Meteor air-to-air missile, SCALP cruise missile, and HAMMER precision-guided bombs, provides the IAF with a significant strategic advantage.</p>

            <img src="pics/mirage.jpeg" alt="loading..." class="mirage">
            <p class="para3">The Dassault Mirage series, developed by France's Dassault Aviation, encompasses a range of supersonic fighter aircraft renowned for their delta-wing designs and versatility. The Mirage III, introduced in the late 1950s, was the first Western European combat aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in horizontal flight. Its success led to the development of variants like the Mirage 5 and Mirage 50, which featured modifications in avionics and powerplants to suit various operational needs. The Mirage 5, for instance, was designed for ground-attack missions with simplified avionics, making it cost-effective for several air forces. India incorporated the Mirage 2000 into its fleet in the 1980s, acquiring 49 aircraft to bolster its air defense capabilities. The Mirage 2000 played a pivotal role during the 1999 Kargil War, executing precision strikes at high altitudes. Recognizing its effectiveness, India later upgraded its fleet to the Mirage 2000-5 standard, enhancing avionics, radar systems, and weapon compatibility. This modernization ensured the aircraft remained a formidable component of the Indian Air Force's combat strategy</p>
