            <div class="content">
                <p > India's defence system is one of the most robust and well-structured in the world, designed to
                    ensure
                    national security and protect its sovereignty. It is composed of three main branches:<span
                        class="highlight">the Indian
                        Army, Indian Navy, and Indian Air Force</span>. The Indian Army defends the country’s land
                    borders and
                    maintains internal peace. The Indian Navy secures maritime boundaries and plays a vital role in
                    regional naval diplomacy. The Indian Air Force safeguards Indian airspace and provides aerial
                    support during combat. India also has paramilitary forces like the Border Security Force (BSF) and
                    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) plays
                    a key role in indigenous defence technology development. India maintains a credible nuclear
                    deterrent and has a “no first use” nuclear policy. It is among the top importers and increasingly a
                    producer of defence equipment. The Indian defence system is constantly evolving to meet modern
                    security challenges.</p>
