        <h1>Indian Army Missions</h1>
        <p>The Indian Army has participated in a number of major missions, both within India and internationally. These missions often involve humanitarian aid, peacekeeping, and military operations aimed at maintaining security and peace.</p>
        <h2>Kargil War</h2>
        <p>The Kargil War (1999) was a conflict between India and Pakistan in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir, triggered by the infiltration of Pakistani soldiers and militants into Indian territory. Pakistan's aim was to gain control of the strategically important region, but India swiftly launched Operation Vijay to reclaim the lost territory. The Indian Army faced extreme conditions in the rugged, high-altitude terrain, engaging in fierce battles, including key operations in sectors like Drass and Tiger Hill. The Indian Air Force also played a crucial role in supporting ground troops. After intense combat, India successfully reclaimed all the captured areas by July 26, 1999.</p>
        <p>The victory in the Kargil War marked a significant moment for India, demonstrating the courage and determination of its soldiers. Despite heavy casualties, including over 500 Indian soldiers, India emerged victorious, forcing Pakistan to withdraw from the territory. The war led to Pakistan’s international isolation and strengthened India's position in the region. Kargil Vijay Diwas, celebrated annually on July 26th, honors the bravery and sacrifice of the Indian Army during this conflict.</p>
        <h2>India's Peacekeeping Missions: A Global Commitment</h2>
        <p>The Indian Army has been actively involved in United Nations peacekeeping missions since the 1950s, contributing to global peace efforts. In missions like those in Lebanon and Congo, Indian soldiers have worked to stabilize conflict zones, provide humanitarian aid, and support the reconstruction of war-torn regions. India's commitment to peacekeeping has earned it international recognition for the professionalism and bravery of its forces. The Indian Battalion in Lebanon and Indian troops in Congo have been crucial in maintaining ceasefires, protecting civilians, and assisting in the disarmament process.</p>
        <p>In these missions, the Indian Army's role extends beyond military engagement; it includes building relationships with local populations, providing medical assistance, and supporting efforts for long-term peace and stability. Despite the challenges of working in volatile regions, Indian peacekeepers have consistently demonstrated resilience and dedication. India's involvement in peacekeeping reflects its broader commitment to promoting global security and humanitarian values under the banner of the United Nations.</p>
        <h2>Operation Sindoor </h2>
        <p>Operation Sindoor was a significant military operation launched by the Indian Armed Forces on May 7, 2025, in response to a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on April 22, which resulted in the loss of 26 civilian lives. The operation involved precision air and missile strikes targeting nine terror-linked sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Indian military's swift and coordinated action was widely regarded as a robust response to cross-border terrorism.</p>
        <p>The operation garnered national attention, particularly due to the leadership of Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, who led the official briefing on the mission. Her role highlighted the increasing prominence of women in India's defense sector. Additionally, the deployment of Bengaluru-made SkyStriker suicide drones marked a significant advancement in India's indigenous defense capabilities. The operation's success was also acknowledged internationally, with the Indian Army briefing defense attachés from approximately 70 countries on its execution.</p>
