      <p class="about">
        The Indian Army possesses a diverse range of missiles that enhance its
        tactical and strategic capabilities. Key among them are the BrahMos
        cruise missile and Agni series ballistic missiles, including the
        long-range Agni-V. For short-range battlefield roles, the Prithvi-II
        missile provides quick-response strike power. NAG serves as an advanced
        anti-tank guided missile, while Akash offers strong air defense against
        aerial threats. These missiles, many of which are indigenously
        developed, significantly strengthen India's defense posture and
        deterrence capability.

              <p class="card-text">
                The BrahMos missile is one of the world’s fastest and most
                advanced supersonic cruise missiles, developed jointly by India
                and Russia. It can be launched from land, air, sea, and sub-sea
                platforms, making it extremely versatile and strategic. With a
                top speed of Mach 2.8 to 3.0 and a range of up to 500 km,
                BrahMos is capable of delivering precision strikes against
                high-value targets. Its ability to fly at low altitudes and
                perform evasive maneuvers makes it difficult to intercept. The
                missile carries a conventional warhead of up to 300 kg and is
                guided by an advanced navigation system. BrahMos is a major
                force multiplier for the Indian armed forces, enhancing their
                deep-strike capability. Its induction has significantly boosted
                India’s deterrence and rapid-response capabilities. The missile
                continues to evolve, with newer variants like BrahMos NG and
                air-launched versions expanding its operational scope.

                Agni-V is India’s most powerful intercontinental ballistic
                missile (ICBM), developed by the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO). It has a range of over 5,000
                kilometers, enabling it to reach targets across Asia, Europe,
                and parts of Africa. Agni-V is capable of carrying a nuclear
                warhead and uses a three-stage solid-fuel propulsion system for
                improved mobility and reliability. The missile is canisterized,
                allowing for quick launch and better storage and transport. It
                travels at hypersonic speeds during re-entry, making
                interception extremely difficult. Agni-V plays a crucial role in
                India’s nuclear deterrence strategy under its “No First Use”
                policy. Its development showcases India’s advanced missile
                technology and strategic capabilities. With successful tests and
                deployment, Agni-V strengthens India’s position as a responsible
                global nuclear power.

              <p class="card-text">
                Prithvi-II is a short-range ballistic missile developed by India
                under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme
                (IGMDP). It has a range of approximately 350 kilometers and can
                carry both conventional and nuclear warheads up to 1,000 kg. The
                missile uses liquid fuel propulsion and is known for its high
                accuracy, thanks to an advanced inertial guidance system.
                Prithvi-II is primarily operated by the Indian Army and serves
                as a tactical missile for battlefield use. Its quick deployment
                and launch capability make it suitable for rapid response
                scenarios. The missile can hit targets with precision, making it
                effective against enemy installations and troop concentrations.
                Regular successful test firings demonstrate its operational
                readiness and reliability. Prithvi-II continues to be a key
                component of India's short-range strike capabilities.
