        <p class="about">The Indian Army possesses a diverse range of missiles that enhance its tactical and strategic capabilities.
            Key among them are the **BrahMos** cruise missile and **Agni series** ballistic missiles, including the
            long-range **Agni-V**. For short-range battlefield roles, the **Prithvi-II** missile provides quick-response
            strike power. **NAG** serves as an advanced anti-tank guided missile, while **Akash** offers strong air
            defense against aerial threats. These missiles, many of which are indigenously developed, significantly
            strengthen India's defense posture and deterrence capability.

                    <p class="card-text content">The **BrahMos missile** is one of the world’s fastest and most advanced
                        supersonic cruise missiles, developed jointly by India and Russia. It can be launched from land,
                        air, sea, and sub-sea platforms, making it extremely versatile and strategic. With a top speed
                        of Mach 2.8 to 3.0 and a range of up to 500 km, BrahMos is capable of delivering precision
                        strikes against high-value targets. Its ability to fly at low altitudes and perform evasive
                        maneuvers makes it difficult to intercept. The missile carries a conventional warhead of up to
                        300 kg and is guided by an advanced navigation system. BrahMos is a major force multiplier for
                        the Indian armed forces, enhancing their deep-strike capability. Its induction has significantly
                        boosted India’s deterrence and rapid-response capabilities. The missile continues to evolve,
                        with newer variants like BrahMos NG and air-launched versions expanding its operational scope.

                    <p class="card-text content">**Agni-V** is India’s most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),
                        developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It has a range of over
                        5,000 kilometers, enabling it to reach targets across Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa. Agni-V
                        is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and uses a three-stage solid-fuel propulsion system for
                        improved mobility and reliability. The missile is canisterized, allowing for quick launch and
                        better storage and transport. It travels at hypersonic speeds during re-entry, making
                        interception extremely difficult. Agni-V plays a crucial role in India’s nuclear deterrence
                        strategy under its “No First Use” policy. Its development showcases India’s advanced missile
                        technology and strategic capabilities. With successful tests and deployment, Agni-V strengthens
                        India’s position as a responsible global nuclear power.

                    <p class="card-text content">**Prithvi-II** is a short-range ballistic missile developed by India under the
                        Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). It has a range of approximately 350
                        kilometers and can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads up to 1,000 kg. The missile uses
                        liquid fuel propulsion and is known for its high accuracy, thanks to an advanced inertial
                        guidance system. Prithvi-II is primarily operated by the Indian Army and serves as a tactical
                        missile for battlefield use. Its quick deployment and launch capability make it suitable for
                        rapid response scenarios. The missile can hit targets with precision, making it effective
                        against enemy installations and troop concentrations. Regular successful test firings
                        demonstrate its operational readiness and reliability. Prithvi-II continues to be a key
                        component of India's short-range strike capabilities.
