  <div class="about-body">
    <p>Special Forces are elite units of the Indian Armed Forces trained to carry out high-risk and specialized
      missions. They operate in extreme and hostile environments, including land, sea, air, and behind enemy
      lines. Some of the most prominent Indian Special Forces include the Para Special Forces (Para SF), MARCOS
      (Marine Commandos), Garud Commando Force, and the National Security Guard (NSG). These forces are tasked
      with critical operations such as counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, deep reconnaissance, and covert strikes.
      The Para SF are known for their stealth and surgical strikes, while MARCOS specialize in maritime and
      underwater missions. Garud Commandos safeguard vital Air Force assets and conduct rescue and combat
      operations. The NSG, often called "Black Cats," handle high-profile counter-terrorism scenarios. Special
      Forces personnel undergo some of the toughest training in the world, requiring extreme physical endurance,
      mental resilience, and advanced combat skills.
