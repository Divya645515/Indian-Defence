      <p class="text-justify">
        In today’s era of modern warfare, technology plays a crucial role in determining the strength and strategy of a nation’s military. One such technology that has transformed the battlefield is the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), more commonly known as a drone.
        The Indian Armed Forces have increasingly adopted drones for surveillance, combat, and intelligence purposes. Let’s explore the list of drones used by Indian Armed Forces, and take a look at the prominent drones in India’s defence arsenal.
        Drones have become an integral part of modern warfare, providing real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. The Indian Armed Forces have recognized the significance of drones in enhancing operational efficiency and situational awareness on the battlefield.
