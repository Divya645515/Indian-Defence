        <h1>Indian Army Missiles</h1>
        <p>The Indian Army has developed a formidable missile arsenal over the years, enhancing its capabilities in both defense and deterrence. India's missile program began with the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969, which laid the groundwork for the country's advancements in missile technology. One of the earliest and most significant achievements was the development of the Prithvi missile, a short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile. The Prithvi missile, developed under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP), marked a milestone in India's defense capabilities and was inducted into the Indian Army in the early 2000s. This missile's range and precision made it a key strategic asset. Over time, India expanded its missile repertoire, introducing more advanced systems such as the Agni series, BrahMos, and Nirbhay, which significantly increased the country’s deterrent and strike capabilities.</p>
        <p>The Agni series of missiles, which include short, medium, and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles, are some of India’s most powerful weapons. The Agni-I missile, which has a range of 700 kilometers, was followed by the more advanced Agni-II and Agni-III, which have ranges of 2,000 and 3,000 kilometers, respectively. The crown jewel of this series is the Agni-V, an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of striking targets up to 5,000 kilometers away, making it a potent strategic asset in India’s nuclear deterrence strategy. These missiles are nuclear-capable, ensuring India's second-strike capability in the event of a nuclear attack. Along with the Agni series, India also developed the BrahMos missile, a supersonic cruise missile that is the fastest in its class. The BrahMos missile, which can be launched from land, air, sea, and underwater platforms, has become a cornerstone of India's defense strategy due to its accuracy and speed.</p>
        <p>The Indian Army has also developed subsonic and hypersonic missiles to enhance its capability for both conventional and strategic strikes. The Nirbhay missile, for instance, is a long-range subsonic cruise missile capable of carrying a variety of payloads, including nuclear warheads, and can be launched from multiple platforms. India’s development of hypersonic technologies is also in progress, with the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV) being successfully tested. This development is expected to give the Indian Army the ability to strike targets at speeds exceeding Mach 5, which will significantly improve the effectiveness and survivability of its missile systems. India’s missile program has evolved from being primarily defensive to a sophisticated mix of deterrence and offensive capabilities, allowing the Indian Army to maintain a strategic edge in the region. With continued advancements in missile technology, India aims to strengthen its defense posture and maintain peace through credible deterrence.</p>
