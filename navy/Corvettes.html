            INS Kamorta is the first of four anti-submarine Kamorta-class stealth corvettes which has been built for the Indian Navy.

It is a significant step towards India's pursuit for self-reliance in indigenous warship building, bringing closer home Indian Navy's quest to be a true Blue-Water Navy with ships and submarines designed and built within the country. She was designed and manufactured by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE),[7][8] launched on 19 April 2010, as part of Project 28, approved in 2003. The ship was named after Kamorta island in Andaman and Nicobar, India .

              INS Kadmatt (P29) is the second of four anti-submarine warfare corvettes built for the Indian Navy by the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, of Kolkata, under Project 28. She was inducted into the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy.

INS Kadmatt has been named after Kadmat Island in India's Lakshadweep Islands, and carries on the legacy of her predecessor INS Kadmatt (P 78), which served the Navy for 24 years, from 23 December 1968 to 30 November 1992.[6]

                INS Kavaratti (P31) is an anti-submarine warfare corvette of the Indian Navy built under Project 28. It is the last of four Kamorta-class corvettes. The ship was built by the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, Kolkata, and launched on 19 May 2015. Kavaratti represents a leap forward in the Navy's attempts at indigenisation with as much as 90% of its content drawn from India itself.[7] It was commissioned into the Navy on 22 October 2020 in Visakhapatnam.[8][9][10][11]

               In early 2011, the ship was part of a fleet of warships from the Eastern Fleet which went on an operational deployment in South East Asia and the Western Pacific.[2] The flotilla was composed of the INS Delhi, INS Ranvijay, INS Ranvir, INS Jyoti and INS Kirch, and carried 1,400 naval personnel on board. They were commanded by Rear Admiral Harish Chandra Singh Bisht. The flotilla, along with an Indian Navy maritime reconnaissance aircraft took part in a five-day exercise SIMBEX 2011 with the Singapore Navy in the South China Sea. Four naval ships including a submarine of the Singapore Navy were commanded by Rear Admiral Joseph Leong, Fleet Commander of the Republic of Singapore Navy.
