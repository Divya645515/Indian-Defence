              Visakhapatnam was also moved in a week later and was tasked to patrol the north Arabian Sea.[15] On 18 January 2024, Visakhapatnam responded to a distress call from the Marshall Island-flagged MV Genco Picardy following a drone attack by unknown attackers at 11.11 pm on the night of 17 January. The Indian naval ship acknowledged the distress call and intercepted the vessel at 12.30 am the next day and provided support. Genco Picardy had 22 crew, including 9 Indian sailors. Following an EOD inspection by the ship's specialists, the ship was cleared to continue its journey without any casualties incurred aboard.[16][17][18][19]

                INS Mysore was built at Mazagon Dock Limited in Mumbai. Her keel was laid down in February 1991 and she was launched on 4 June 1993. Sea trials began in the Arabian Sea in March 1999, and she was commissioned on 2 June 1999 with the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the Chief Guest.
