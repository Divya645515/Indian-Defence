      <h1>Tankers</h1>
      <p class="about">The Indian Army uses powerful tanks like the Arjun, T-90 Bhishma, and T-72 Ajeya for ground
        combat operations. These tanks are equipped with heavy armor, long-range cannons, and advanced targeting systems
        for precision in battle. They play a vital role in border defense, especially in open terrains such as deserts
        and plains. Tank regiments are trained for rapid strikes, defensive formations, and support during large-scale
        missions. To stay battle-ready, Indian tanks are regularly upgraded to meet the demands of modern warfare and
        match global military standards.</p>

          <h3>T-72 Fleet</h3>
          <p>The T-72 is a family of Soviet main battle tanks that entered production in 1973.[8] The T-72 was a
            development based on the T-64 using thought and design of the previous Object 167M.[9][10] About 25,000 T-72
            tanks have been built, and refurbishment has enabled many to remain in service for decades.</p>

          <h3>Arjun</h3>
          <p>The Arjun is a third-generation main battle tank designed for the Indian Army by the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation’s Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment. Work on the design began
            in 1986 and was completed in 1996. In 2004, the Indian Army accepted the Arjun main combat tank into
            service. The Arjun was originally awarded to the 43rd Armoured Regiment, which was founded in 2009.</p>

          <h3>T-90/Bhishma</h3>
          <p>The T-90S is the most recent addition to Russia’s T-series of tanks, and it boasts increased firepower,
            mobility, and protection. Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, Russia, produces it. It was first used by the
            Russian Army in 1992. The Indian Army secured a deal for 310 T-90S tanks in February 2001, 124 were built in
            Russia and the remainder was shipped in ‘knocked down’ shape for final assembly in India.</p>
