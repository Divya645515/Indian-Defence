      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        The Indian Army (ISO: Bhāratīya Sēnā) is the land-based branch and
        largest component of the Indian Armed Forces, making it the world’s
        second-largest army and the fourth most powerful military globally.[3]
        The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,[4]
        and its professional head is the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS). The
        Indian Army was established on 1 April 1895 alongside the long
        established presidency armies of the East India Company, which too were
        absorbed into it in 1903. Some princely states maintained their own
        armies which formed the Imperial Service Troops which, along with the
        Indian Army formed the land component of the Armed Forces of the Crown
        of India, responsible for the defence of the Indian Empire.[5][6] The
        Imperial Service Troops were merged into the Indian Army after
        independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse
        histories and have participated in several battles and campaigns around
        the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before and after
        Independence.[7]The Indian Army is the land-based branch of the Indian
        Armed Forces. It protects the nation's borders and keeps peace during
        wars and disasters.Until the independence of India, the "Indian Army"
        was a British-commanded force defined as "the force recruited locally
        and permanently based in India, together with its expatriate British
        officers"; the "British Army in India" referred to British Army units
        posted to India for a tour of duty. The "Army of India" meant the
        combined Indian Army and the British Army in India. It uses modern
        equipment like tanks, rifles, and missile systems and plays a vital role
        in rescue operations and national security.
